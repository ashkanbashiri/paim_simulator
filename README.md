# paim_simulator
Urban intersection simulator developed with Matlab

## Running the simulator
Open 'simulator.m' in Matlab and click on RUN. 

## Setting up a simulation
From the "Simulation Settings" form group, select a Traffic Level, Duration of your choice. Leave sim. speed at 1x. Select the "Grouped" policy. On the Platoon Settings form, select a maximum platoon size of your choice. Click on "Run" button to start the simulation.
